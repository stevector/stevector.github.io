title: Plugin Haikus - Drupalcon Portland presentation
---

Last month at Drupalcon Portland I gave [a presentation on CTools plugins](http://portland2013.drupal.org/node/1458) along with [Pedro Cambra](https://twitter.com/pcambra). My half of the presentation focuses on working with existing plugins in [the Panels module](http://drupal.org/project/panels). Panels has one of the steeper learning curves in Drupal. Its complexity presents a challenge when debugging. I breakdown the Panels workflow into its component plugins and discuss the purpose of the plugin types.

And we framed the presentation with haikus.

Each section included a haiku to distill the topic to a more approachable state. So the explanation of access plugins began with the haiku:

> Give it a context
> And some configuration.
> Get back TRUE or FALSE.

Watch the video on YouTube or go straight to [the slides](http://stevector.github.io/plugin-haikus/) to see the haikus along with deeper explanations. If you like the poems, [follow @DrupalHaikus on Twitter](https://twitter.com/DrupalHaikus).
